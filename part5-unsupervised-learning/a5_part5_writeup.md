# Part 5 - Unsupervised Learning Writeup

After completing `a6_part5.py` answer the following questions

## Questions to answer

1. Develop a name for each customer group based on the information from the graph. For example, one group might be called “Frugal” while another might be called “Shopaholic.” Explain your reasoning for each label.

 - top left: finance influencers, they spend a disproportionate amount from their earnings
 - bottom left: normal low, make little spend little
 - top right: unc, make lots spend lots
 - bottom right: cartel, they make lots but spend little
 - middle: average joe, they make a medium ammount of money and spend a reasonable ammount

2. What group would a customer who has a medium income and low spending habits be in?

Cartel, you could argue that this is a bad grouping, there should be another group for middle right. 

3. Choose one cluster of interest to you. How might the marketing team approach this specific customer group?

I would target middle because the cartel group probably is already set on keeping their money as cash. If I was marketing team I would target middle with investment options, because they have the liquidity to buy in, and they dont waste all their money. If I wanted to make everyone in the marketing team rich, I would go after the top left, finance influencers, and sell crazy loans on nice cars.
