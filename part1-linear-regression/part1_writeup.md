# Part 1 - Linear Regression Writeup

After completing `a6_part1.py` answer the following questions

## Questions to answer

1. What is the r squared value?  What does this say about this linear regression model?
The r squared value indicates how well the model fits the data. A low r squared means the model does not explain much of the variability, suggesting it may not be a strong predictor.

2. According to your model, what is the predicted systolic blood pressure for a person who is 42 years old?
137.15

3. How accurate do you think this model's predictions are?  Do you think this model is accurate enough to reliably predict someone's blood pressure based on their age?  Why or why not?  And if not, what could improve the model?

The model likely isn't very acurate, as blood pressure is influenced by many factors besides age. Adding more features like weight or lifestyle could improve it.
