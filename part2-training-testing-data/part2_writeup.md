# Part 2 - Training and Testing Data Writeup

After completing `a6_part2.py` answer the following questions

## Questions to answer

1. What makes this model more effective than the model you created in the previous lesson?

This model is more effective because it uses a training and testing split, which helps evaluate the model's performance on unseen data. This provides a more realistic measure of the model's predictive accuracy, reducing the risk of overfitting to the training data.

2. What does the R squared coefficient tell you about the model?

The R squared value is decently high which suggests that the model fits the data well.

3. Would you say that your model is accurate? What evidence supports your conclusion? Consider the meaning of the predicted and actual values in the context of the chart below from the American Heart Associationâ€™s website on understanding blood pressure.

Yes, the model appears accurate since the high R squared value suggests a good fit. Additionally, the predicted values closely align with the actual values in the test set.
