# Part 3 - Multivariable Linear Regression Writeup

After completing `a6_part3.py` answer the following questions

## Questions to answer

1. What is the R Squared coefficient for your model? What does that mean about the model in relation to your data?

The R squared value indicates how well the model explains the variability in car prices. In this case, an R squared of 0.85 suggests that the model explains about 85% of the variance in the data, indicating a strong fit.

2. Is your model accurate? Why or why not?

The R squared value of around 0.86 is decent, showing that the model is fairly accurate. However, it is not perfect and could benefit from more testing data.

3. What does the model predict a 10-year-old car with 89000 miles is worth? What about a car that is 20 years old with 150000 miles?

4. You may notice that some of your predicted results are negative. This is occurring when the value of age and the mileage of the car are very high. Why do you think this is happening?
